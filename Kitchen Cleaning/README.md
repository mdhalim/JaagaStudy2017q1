Cleaning the kitchen keeps all the germs and pests away and allows you all to savour the sumptuous smell of the food and sit on the spanking clean dining area everytime you step inside the Kitchen!  

Kitchen Cleaning needs to be done 3 times a day since you don't wanna come and see the mess left by your fellow primates when they finish eating and leaves the floor messy with their footprints or the pots and utensils unclean. Its absolutely important for all of us to contribute to maintaing cleanliness.  

So, we will keep the issues open everyday for morning, afternoon and dinner! Feel free to join in and take the tasks!  

Cleanliness as they say is next to godliness!
