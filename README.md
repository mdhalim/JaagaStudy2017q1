# JaagaStudy2017q1

Welcome to the Volunteering Issues tracker for the 2017 Q1 bootcamp!

The volunteer part of the program is oriented around the physical needs of our community.  
People who continue will learn more about solar energy, LED lighting, water and waste management. Some volunteers also help with our school outreach program bringing Android tablets to kids in our area.
